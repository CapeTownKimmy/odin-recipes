# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes HTML is the first part of a multi-part project that will    
showcase my skills from the HTML fundamentals course section. 
In this project, I will create a multi-page website with proper HTML 
semantics to create a functional basic recipe website. In future parts 
of this project, I will use CSS and JavaScript to enhance the basic website.

Projects Goals:

1. Standard file setup and management
2. Use semantic HTML to build the website framework
3. Show understanding of Git Commit and Git workflow
4. Publish the website to GitHub
