        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>135g plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>130 ml full-cream milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tbsp melted butter, plus extra for cooking.</li>
            <li>1-2 Bananas</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup blueberries</li>
            <li>2 Strawberries</li>
            <li>Maple syrup to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, salt and caster sugar into a large bowl. In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together the milk and eggs. then whisk in the melted butter.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When its melted, add a ladle of batter in the shape of blob monsters. It will seem very thick but this is how it should be.</li>
            <li>Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm thick.</li>
            <li>Repeat until all the batter is used up.</li>
            <li>Wash the berries and set them aside. Cut the bananas into slices for eyes and triangles for teeth.</li>
            <li>Plate you Munchy Monster pancakes, decorate with the fruit and serve!</li>
        </ol>
